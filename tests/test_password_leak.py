"""
tests/test_password_leak.py  –  Verify password hash is never leaked in API responses.

The get_current_customer() dependency previously returned the bcrypt password hash
in every authenticated response. This test asserts that no API response schema
contains the string "password" as a serialized key.

This runs as a unit test against the response schema models, not the full API,
so it doesn't depend on TestClient or database connectivity.
