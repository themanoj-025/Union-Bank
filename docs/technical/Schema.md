| TBL-savings_account.account_id | TBL-account | 1:1 | Cascade | Kind-of relationship |
| TBL-loan.user_id | TBL-user | N:1 | Restrict | Keep loan history |

## 4. Indexes

| Table | Index | Columns | Type | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TBL-transaction | ix_tx_created | created_at | btree | History pagination |
| TBL-transaction | ix_tx_accounts | from_account_id, to_account_id | composite | Account queries |
| TBL-transaction | ix_tx_idem | idempotency_key | unique | Dedupe |
| TBL-refresh_token | ix_rt_user | user_id | btree | Rotation lookup |

## 5. Enums / Constants

| Field | Allowed Values |
| --- | --- |
| user.role | customer, admin |
| account.type | checking, savings |
| account.status | active, frozen, closed |
| transaction.type | transfer, deposit, withdraw |
| transaction.status | completed, failed, rolled_back |
| loan.status | active, paid, closed |
| LOCKOUT_THRESHOLD | 5 attempts |
| LOCKOUT_MINUTES | 15 |
| MONEY_OPS_PER_HOUR | 5 (account rate limit) |
| REFRESH_TTL_DAYS | 7 |

## 6. Data Lifecycle

- Retention: financial records retained indefinitely (audit); refresh tokens purged after expiry + 30 days.
- Deletion: accounts soft-frozen before close; hard delete only for unpopulated test rows.
- ADR-0004 governs retention + idempotency.

## 7. Migrations Strategy

- Alembic; SQLite dev ↔ PostgreSQL prod; 5 round-trip migration tests (upgrade/downgrade).
- Naming `NNNN_short_desc`; every migration shipped with its PR + Schema.md update.

## 8. Sample Records

```json
{
  "user": { "id": "u1", "email": "ada@example.com", "role": "customer", "token_version": 1 },
  "account": { "id": "a1", "user_id": "u1", "account_number": "UB-100-0001", "balance": 12480.00, "version": 3 },
  "transaction": { "id": "t1", "from_account_id": "a1", "to_account_id": "a2", "amount": 250.00, "type": "transfer", "status": "completed" },
  "refresh_token": { "id": "r1", "user_id": "u1", "family": "f1", "expires_at": "2026-08-13T10:00:00Z" }
}
```

## 9. Data Validation Rules

| Field | Enforced In | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| account.balance | DB CHECK + App | ≥ 0 |
| transaction.amount | DB CHECK + App | > 0 |
| email | App + DB unique | Valid format |
| refresh token reuse | App | Rotation → revoke family |
| transfer sufficiency | App | Insufficient funds → 400 |

## 10. Sensitive Data Map

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| user.email | PII | Yes | Yes |
| password_hash | Credential | Hashed | N/A |
| totp secret | Credential | Yes | Never logged |
