## 1. Design Principles

1. **Trust through clarity** — banking UI must be unambiguous about amounts, statuses, and confirmations.
2. **Calm density** — dashboards show real data without noise.
3. **Safety rails** — every destructive action requires explicit confirmation.
4. **Consistent states** — loading/error/empty handled everywhere, identically.
5. **Accessibility by default** — AA contrast, keyboard-first forms.

## 2. Brand & Visual Identity

- **Tone:** institutional, trustworthy, modern. Banking blue + neutral grays.
- **Imagery:** no stock photos; iconography + charts only.
- **Name:** "Union Bank Management System" — professional demo brand.
