    Add CHECK (balance >= 0) constraint to accounts table.

    This is a defense-in-depth measure — the application layer already
    prevents negative balances in withdraw() and transfer(), but the
    DB-level constraint ensures no bug or race condition can corrupt
    balance data.

    Note: Uses batch_alter_table because SQLite does not support
    ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT. Batch mode recreates the table with
    the new constraint in a single atomic step.
