domain/clock.py  –  Shared time utilities for the domain layer.

Provides a single source of truth for timezone-aware UTC timestamps,
eliminating the ``_utcnow()`` copy-paste that previously existed across
7+ files. All domain entities, application services, and infrastructure
code should import ``utcnow`` from here rather than defining their own.
